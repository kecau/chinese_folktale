This study aims to analyze the influence of story components (e.g., spatio-temporal back- grounds and characters) on the similarity of Chinese folktales and reveal the phenomenon of component changes in similar stories. To this end, here, we replaced the text of the story components with wildcards and combined the text with document embedding to enable experimentation with widely circulated Chinese folktales. We express the impor- tant information of the embedded text by mining all the story components that satisfy the wildcard constraint from the given target text and calculate the similarity. We evaluated the proposed method using a questionnaire. The results show that the document embed- ding method with wildcard processing can determine the influence of story components on similarity and perceive changes in the components of similar stories.
